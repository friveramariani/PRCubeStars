***Félix E. Rivera-Mariani, PhD***: *Principal Investigator of PRCubeStars*. Dr. Rivera-Mariani is an immunologist, aerobiologist, and computational biological and non-biological data science expert. Originally from Arroyo, PR (same hometown and neighborhood as Dr. Sierra-Sastre (see below)), Dr. Rivera-Mariani was also an athlete in his hometown, representing Puerto Rico in international baseball competitions in the years 1990, 1993, and 1996. In 1996, Dr. Rivera-Mariani declined an offer by the Seattle Mariners to be drafted in the 25th round of the Major League Baseball amateur Draft to eventually follow his dream of playing Division-I collegiate baseball. He received an athletic scholarship from Southeastern Louisiana University, from where he earned a Bachelors in Science in Biology with a minor in Chemistry. After spending a few years working in an environmental laboratory ([EQ Lab](http://www.eqlab.com/)), he was accepted in graduate school, where he earned a PhD in Microbiology from the Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. He later applied and was accepted in a postdoctoral fellowship in environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, under the mentorship of [Dr. Patric Breysse](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/ncehatsdr.html) and [Dr. Thomas Hartung](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2308/thomas-hartung). In this fellowship, Dr. Rivera-Mariani was in charge of expanding the utility of human-based immunological assays to assess the potential respiratory health effects of airborne biological pollutants in different environmental settings. Dr. Rivera Mariani also completed fellowships in [Science Teaching](https://www.asm.org/index.php/science-teaching-fellows-course), and training in Computational Data Science and Genomic Data Science, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, and Software Development in the R computer language (find more credentials [here](http://friveram.com/education/)). Currently, Dr. Rivera-Mariani is an Assistant Professor and Academic Director at the <a href="http://ularkin.org/college-of-biomedical-sciences/">College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University</a> and maintains active scientific collaborations to assess the immunotoxicology and respiratory health potential effects of fungal spores endemic in the tropics, such as the Caribbean region (find recent publications [here](http://friveram.com/publications/)).
