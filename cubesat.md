## What is a CubeSat?

A **CubeSat** is a low-cost miniaturized spacecraft, often referred as nanosatellite. These nanosatellites were initially developed in the late 1990s by professors [Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Puig-Suari) and [Dr. Bob Twiggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Twiggs) from California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University, respectively. Nowadays, CubeSats have been adopted worldwide, including NASA ([National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/)) and other government, universities, and research entities as a venue for space exploration, mentoring and education of space and aeronautic sciences (find more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)). For example, NASA employs CubeSats for laser communication, satellite-to-satellite communications among other initiatives (find information [here](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-cubesat-launch-initiative-broadens-access-to-space-for-educators-nonprofits)).

The basic structure of a CubeSat is a single unit of 10 x 10 x 10 cm, and it weighs approximately 3 lbs. The small dimensions and lightweight allows integration of low-cost materials and equipments for space exploration, and **in the case of PRCubeStars to explore the stratosphere microbiome** (refer to the [*projects page*](https://friveramariani.github.io/PRCubeStars/projects)).

**It is important to mention** that the fabrication expertise of Dr. Sierra-Sastre and Daron Westly, as well as the computer science and *Making* expertise of Damaso Cardenales-Colón and Carlos Rodríguez have been fundamental in mentoring the students in the design, assembly, and programming of the CubeSat.
