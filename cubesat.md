## What is a CubeSat?

A **CubeSat** is a low-cost miniatiruzed spacecraft, often referred as nanosatellites. These nanosatellites were initially in the late 1990s by professors [Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Puig-Suari) and [Dr. Bob Twiggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Twiggs) of California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University, respectively. Nowdays, is has been adopted wordwilde, including NASA ([National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/)) and other goverment, universities, and research entities as a venue for space exploration and mentoring and education of spacial and aeronautic sciences (find more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)). For example, NASA employ CubESats for laser communiacation, satellite-to-satellite communications among other (find information [here](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-cubesat-launch-initiative-broadens-access-to-space-for-educators-nonprofits)).

It is made by multiple units of 10 x 10 x 10 cm in length, and barely 2.5 lbs (or 1.3 kilograms). These dimensions and lightweight allows integratation into the CubeSat low-scale materials and equipments for space exploration, and **in the case of PRCubeStars to explore the stratosphere microbiome** (refer to the [*projects page*](https://friveramariani.github.io/PRCubeStars/projects)).
